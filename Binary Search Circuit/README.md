***Binary Search Circuit***


With a sorted collection of integers stored in memory already, 
I utilized binary search algorithm to efficiently find the desired value in the array. 
Input is specified by SW7â€“SW0, SW9 is start signal, and KEY0 is reset. 
If there is a value that matches the input, the found signal LEDR9 will be on, 
and the address is shown on the hex display.
